## Netflix Analysis

### Introduction

There has been a huge increase in people cutting ties with their current cable provider and switching to services such as Netflix for on demand streaming services. Netflix was one of the first major streaming options for home television audiences. According to DailyDot, “Netflix was a subscription-based DVD service that would mail DVDs straight to your home”. Netflix has since changed its model to offer a wide range of content for almost any genre you can think of, and is now even producing their own Netflix original shows and movies. Netflix not only provides the end user the ability to watch hundreds of thousands tv shows and movies, but crafts a recommendation algorithm to better tailor their queue to the audience. 
The dataset derived from Kaggle consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset was collected from Flixable, a third party Netflix search engine. According to Flixable, “Netflix was only available in the United States, but that changed when the service launched in Canada in 2010”. Nowadays, Netflix has shifted gears to producing Netflix original content in order to provide their users with the best possible content for tv shows and movies. Through the dataset provided by Flixable and Kaggle, I will use exploratory data analysis to answer the following questions:
-	Are movies or tv shows more popular on Netflix?
-	Most popular tv ratings and genres?
-	How recent/old are the options available on Netflix?
-	Top 10 Genres of tv shows
-	Top 10 genres of movies
-	Which countries utilize Netflix the most?
-	Can I create a recommendation system based off of this dataset?
